# Building installer package

## Building Windows installer

### Launch4j

Launch4j is a cross-platform tool for wrapping Java applications distributed as
jars in lightweight Windows native executables. The executable can be configured
to search for a certain JRE version or use a bundled one, and it's possible to
set runtime options, like the initial/max heap size.

The wrapper also provides better user experience through an application icon,
a native pre-JRE splash screen, and a Java download page in case the appropriate
JRE cannot be found.

You can find a project home page at
https://launch4j.sourceforge.net/

OmegaT project use a Gradle plugin to use launch4j during build process.
The plugin we use is found at
https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/edu.sc.seis.launch4j

There is a gradle task in launch4j group

- createAllExecutables

that will be automatically executed when `win` task selected.

### Inno Setup

We use `Inno Setup` to build windows' installer binary.
Inno Setup is a free installer for Windows programs by Jordan Russell
and Martijn Laan. First introduced in 1997, Inno Setup today rivals
and even surpasses many commercial installers in a feature set and stability.

We can download Inno Setup executable binary that can run on Windows.
It is also able to run with WINE on linux.

There is a docker image built with WINE and linux.

#### Install InnoSetup on Windows

When you want to build a Windows installer package on Windows10/11, you need to prepare InnoSetup6 installation
manually.
Please open your web browser and goto https://jsoftware.org/isdl.php
Select Stable Release `innosetup-6.2.2.exe`, download and install.

After successfully installed, you should go to https://github.com/jsoftware/issrc/tree/is-6_2_2
and click "Code" button on the page, then select "Download ZIP" link.
You will get downloaded zip file named `issrc-is-6_2_2.zip`.
Please open zip file and goto internal folder `Files/Langauges/Unofficial`, and then extract all `*.isl` files
into your InnoSetup installed folder, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup6\Languages\`.

At last, please open the control panel's Systems property and open Environment Variable edit dialog.
Add Inno Setup folder `C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup6\`  in PATH environment variable.
