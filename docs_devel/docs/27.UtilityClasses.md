# Utility classes

There are several utilitity classes which you can use at anywhere you want. 

## HTTP connection utility

When you need to interact with web servers, you can use HTTP connection utility.
If you want remote resource as String, `HttpConnectionUtils#getURL` is what you need.
There are two variants;

    getURL(URL url)

and

    getURL(URL url, int timeout)

A default timeout is 10 seconds.

When you need to download binary file from remote, you can use `downloadBinary` utility method.

    downloadBinaryFile(URL fileURL, Map<String, String> headers,
        Set<String> expectedMime, File saveFilePath)

It will return `true` when successfully download the file.
You should provide headers, and expected MIME types.

When you need to download zip file from remote and extract its contents, use can use `downloadZipAndExtract`

    downloadZipFileAndExtract(URL url, File dir, List<String> expectedFiles) 

It takes target directory and expected filename list.

These utilities use `URL#openConnection` method. It looks system property for proxy connections.

There are also some primitive connection utilities.
There are `get`, `post`, and `postJson`.


## HTML Utilities

When you handle HTML text, you will need to convert HTML excape characters into UTF-8.
`HTMLUtils#entitiesToChars`  is what you want.

There is also a `HTMLUtils#charsToEntities` which does reverse things.

## Encoding Detector

When we read arbitrary text files from disk, we sometimes need to detect character encodings.
`EncodingDetector#detectEncoding` is one we used in glossary reader.
When there are enough characters, it detects an encoding correctly.
There are also a variant  `detectEndocingDefault` that accept default encoding.

## Json Parser

There is a json parser based on Java internal Nashorn javascript scripting engine.
Because Java 17 removes javascript engine from JVM, the parser is deprecated.
You are recommended to use Jackson JSON parser instead.


## StaticUtils

- `getConfigDir`: get omegat configuration directory such as `$HOME/.omegat/`
- `installDir`: get omegat installation directory where `OmegaT.jar` exists.
- `getScriptDir`: get directory where scripts are installed.
 

## StringUtil

There are several must use utility methods in `StringUtil` class.

- `isEmpty(@Nullable String str)`: check string is null or empty string("")

- `toTitleCase:` convert string as title case.

## Platform

When you need to detect platform such as Windows, macOS or Linux, there is a class for the purpose.

It is an enum to express platform types.

    public enum OsType {
        // os.arch=amd64, os.name=Linux, os.version=3.0.0-12-generic
        LINUX64,
        // os.arch=i386, os.name=Linux, os.version=3.0.0-12-generic
        LINUX32,
        // os.arch=x86_64, os.name=Mac OS X, os.version=10.6.8
        MAC64,
        // os.arch=i386, os.name=Mac OS X, os.version=10.6.8
        MAC32,
        // os.arch=amd64, os.name=Windows 7, os.version=6.1
        WIN64,
        // os.arch=x86, os.name=Windows 7, os.version=6.1
        WIN32,
        // unknown system
        OTHER
    }

- `getOsType`: return OS type where OmegaT running in enum.
- `isMacOSX`: true when OmegaT run on macOS.
- `isLinux`: true when OmegaT run on Linux.
- `is64Bit`: true when OemgaT run on 64bit OS platform.
